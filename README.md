# Repeat After Me ðŸ¦€

My very first Rust project â€” made while learning Rust, VSCode, and Linux!

---

## What is it?

A simple terminal program that repeats whatever you type.  
Type anything and it echoes back. Type `q` to quit.

---

## Why?
- As a learning project while reading *The Rust Book*.
- To get hands-on experience with Rust basics and control flow.  
- To get comfortable using VSCode and Linux terminals.  
- To see how Rust can compile to standalone executables you can run on other machines without installing Rust.

## How to run

Make sure you have Rust installed: [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)

Then clone this repo and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bschelske/repeat_after_me.git
